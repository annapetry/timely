#sample

# In the tutorial, this loop was just pasted into the console to generate 100,000 customers

# You can also create a rake task, to see this scroll down!

include Faker

100_000.times. do
	Customer.create(name: Faker::Company.name,
									city: Faker::Address.city,
									zipcode: Faker::Address.zip.to_i,
									state: Faker::Address.state_abbr,
									email: Faker::Internet.email,
									employees: (rand * 100).to_i)
end



# how to create a rake task for generating this fake data

# First, in '/lib/tasks' create a new file 'fake.rake'

# ':environment' makes sure the environment is loaded before running the task

# then, run 'rake fake' in the terminal to execute


task :fake  => :environment do
  100.times do
  	Customer.create(name: Faker::Company.name,
  									city: Faker::Address.city,
  									zipcode: Faker::Address.zip.to_i,
  									state: Faker::Address.state_abbr,
  									email: Faker::Internet.email,
  									employees: (rand * 100).to_i)
